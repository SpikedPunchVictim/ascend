# ascend — Implementation Plan

Stage definitions are `ARCHITECTURE.md`'s (Stage 0–5). Epics are the `bd` issues that implement
them. Per the global workflow this file is deleted when every stage is Complete.

**Status key:** Not Started · In Progress · Complete · Blocked

Evidence records live in `docs/evidence/`. Where a stage has a constraint that was *measured* rather
than designed, it is called out as **EV-constraint** — those are not suggestions; they are what the
spike settled, and re-litigating them requires new measurements.

---

## Stage 0: Spike (throwaway, quarantined)

**Goal** — Answer the 7 empirical questions in `ARCHITECTURE.md` before building any of it, and
surface a negative result loudly if Q2 (does a pattern emerge?) or Q6 (does recording happen?) fails.

**Success Criteria** — `spike/FINDINGS.md` carries measured numbers with a verdict; every question
has an `EV-<n>` record in the fixed shape (Question / Method / Measurement / Decision / Confidence).

**Tests** — N/A; the deliverable is evidence. Each harness is throwaway and quarantined under
`spike/`, excluded from lint (`eslint.config.js` ignores it) and from the build.

**Status: Complete** — verdict **GO-WITH-CHANGES**. Records: `EV-storage`, `EV-corpus`, `EV-drift`,
`EV-patterns`, `EV-fts`, `EV-runtime`. Required changes are owned by later stages and repeated below.
Q6 (does recording happen?) is **NOT answered** — it cannot be, until the CLI exists; it is carried
into Stage 4 as `asc-9an [EMPIRICAL]`.

---

## Stage E1: Repo foundation (pre-stage)

**Goal** — pnpm workspace, TS strict, Vitest, ESLint, `align` as the conformance oracle, mast index,
and the quality gates that every later stage must pass.

**Success Criteria** — `format:check`, `typecheck`, `lint`, `test` and `align check` all exit 0; the
purity contract is machine-enforced at both edit time (ESLint) and check time (align), and is *proven
to fire* against a deliberate violation.

**Tests** — `packages/core/test/purity-enforcement.test.ts` (drives ESLint against a violating fixture
**and** a clean control); `packages/core/test/vocabulary.test.ts`; `packages/analysis/test/min-n.test.ts`;
`packages/cli/test/dev-hooks.test.ts` (hook wiring + the gate's own two-arm behaviour).

**Status: In Progress** — `asc-67s`, `asc-joa.1`, `asc-joa.2` Complete; `asc-l4q` Complete.
**Blocked on user consent:** `asc-joa.3` (dead `core.hooksPath`; all bd + ascend hooks inactive) and
`asc-02u` (gate written and verified, deliberately unarmed). `pnpm test` is currently **red on one
test** — the guard that detects `asc-joa.3`. That red is the honest signal and clears with the fix.

## Stage 1: Core + store + record/query — epics E2, E3, E4

**Goal** — `asc init`, `asc types define`, `asc record`, `asc query` end to end, with the four starter
types installed by `asc init`.

**Success Criteria** — an entry recorded via the CLI is queryable through its generated view; the
three value states round-trip distinctly; an invalid entry is rejected with a compact, prescriptive
error naming field, expected type, and corrected command; `asc init` gitignores `.ascend/`.

**Tests** — Core purity; three-state round-trip; type-version immutability; hash stability;
`buildSchema` spec→zod coverage for every property type in the bounded vocabulary.

**EV-constraints carried in:**
- **`EV-storage`** — shape A (one `entries` table + `properties` JSON + generated per-type views) is
  kept, but it is only competitive **with composite expression/covering indexes emitted at
  type-registration time**: A4 covering index 206.1 ms vs per-type tables 217.1 ms. Naive indexing is
  a trap — the bare-expression index measured *slower than no index* (239.1 vs 231.0 ms) because it
  cannot carry the `type_name` predicate. Also: a `STORED` generated column **cannot be added to a
  populated table** (rejected at 1+ rows), which is why the composite index, not a stored column, is
  the mechanism.
- **`EV-drift`** — define-time canonicalization is required, not optional: across 44 real
  LLM-authored property names only **9.1 %** were shared, Jaccard **0.300**, with snake_case and
  camelCase mixed and `reviewer` typed `ref` in one place and `string` in another. `asc-2gy`
  (define-time duplicate detection) is the mitigation.
- **`EV-patterns`** — `AskUserQuestion` 12/12 and `ExitPlanMode` 11/11 were user-rejected; the
  `tool_name × project` association (χ²=153.11) is an **artifact** and does not survive. Two required
  additions to E7: a **tautology check** and a **temporal-block control** — the shuffled-label control
  catches marginal-driven artifacts but *not* definitional ones, and "Thu 41.1 %" is one burst
  (2026-09-03 alone is 143/409 = 35 % of the corpus).
- **`EV-fts`** — FTS5 uses **trigram** as primary. `unicode61` and `porter` retrieve nothing correct
  for **40 %** of partial-token terms (coverage 60 %) where trigram gets **100 %**. `porter` goes to
  the Design Reserve (its win is confined to stem-changing inflections, `configuring` 2→173).
  The `toFtsMatch` sanitizer port is **mandatory**: 8/14 raw LLM-authored queries throw FTS5 syntax
  errors, and a naive whole-query phrase sanitizer is insufficient (returns empty for 9–13/14).

**Status: In Progress** — **E2 complete** (7/7, epic `asc-72s` closed). E3 (`asc-865`) and E4
(`asc-baj`) not started.

E2 delivered, with the evidence that it holds:
- `spec.ts` — bounded 9-type vocabulary + canonicalization. Renames are **reported**, not applied
  silently, and canonical form is a fixed point (idempotence is what lets it be an identity).
- `schema.ts` — `buildSchema`/`propertySchema`, one exhaustive switch with a `never` check, so
  adding a vocabulary member without handling it is a compile error. Test coverage of the vocabulary
  is enforced against `PROPERTY_TYPES`, so it cannot rot.
- `hash.ts` — pure SHA-256 (`node:crypto` is banned in core; a hash that depends on who computed it
  is not an identity). Verified against **published NIST vectors**, not just self-consistency: a
  hand-written hash passes every "same input, same output" test while being wrong. `node:crypto` was
  added to the purity ban as part of this.
- `state.ts` — the three-state resolver. **`required` accepts an explicit N/A**, which is the whole
  point; a measured `0`, an N/A and silence resolve to three distinct states, and a property asserted
  as two at once is rejected.
- `diff.ts` — bump classification on one axis: *can an old entry still be read correctly?* Adding an
  optional property is minor; adding a **required** one is major, since old entries have no decision
  for it.
- Purity enforcement extended to `Math.random`, `performance`, the `crypto` global and `node:crypto`,
  and now proves both that the rules are **configured for core *and* analysis** and that they
  **fire** (store is the negative control).

Two decisions taken during E2 that were not specified, both chosen to avoid manufacturing false
signal: **property order and enum-value order are canonicalized away** (they are authoring artifacts,
and a reordering reported as drift is a false signal), and **the diff canonicalizes both sides first**
so a rename-only difference is correctly *no* bump.

Gates at close: `format:check 0 · typecheck 0 · lint 0 · test 113 passed · align check green`.

## Stage 2: Claude Code adapter + backfill — epic E5

**Goal** — `asc ingest claude-code` derives entries from existing transcripts.

**Success Criteria** — re-running is idempotent (keyed on transcript uuid); derived entries carry
`source='derived:claude-code'`; the corpus reaches a queryable N on day one.

**Tests** — idempotency on a fixture transcript; envelope correctness; absent-vs-zero on token fields.

**EV-constraints carried in:** `EV-corpus` measured the real corpus at **809 files / 388,054 lines /
1.14 GB** read in **11.2 s** at **213 MB** peak RSS, yielding **69,276 rows in 7.2 s**. Tool-denial
entries reach **N=409** → GO. `user-correction` reaches only **N=20** and is **not an independent
corpus** — do not present it as one.

**Safety constraint (verbatim from `TASKS.md`):** *"Read-only on the transcripts — never write
there."*

**Status: Not Started** (`asc-dh0`)

---

## Stage 3: `asc explore` + `asc search` — epic E6

**Goal** — make a corpus an LLM cannot fit in context readable anyway.

**Success Criteria** — profile mode maps a type without hand-written SQL; all four sampling modes
work; `--max-tokens` fits output to budget and reports what it dropped; every output carries coverage
and stable entry IDs; `--dump` writes a usable `manifest.json`; FTS5 search survives LLM-authored
query strings containing `(`, `:`, `"`, `OR`.

**Tests** — query-sanitization fuzz against FTS5 syntax errors; stratified sampling preserves enum
proportions; cursor stability under concurrent writes; token-budget truncation reporting.

**Status: Not Started** (`asc-qfk`)

---

## Stage 4: Annotation + statistical layer + skill — epics E7, E8, E10

**Goal** — turn a corpus into findings, reproducibly.

**Success Criteria** — an LLM-authored rule applies across the corpus and reports matches *and*
unclassified remainder; back-test yields real precision/recall against a hand-labelled sample; two
competing schemes annotate the same entries simultaneously and `asc kappa` scores agreement; dropping
a scheme loses no entry data; invalidation works as a reserved scheme; every proportion carries a
Wilson interval and small groups are flagged.

**Tests** — `packages/analysis` against fixtures with hand-computed expected values (Wilson, kappa,
chi-square, log-odds, FP-growth support/confidence, CUSUM changepoints); scheme isolation;
immutability of annotated entries.

**EV-constraints carried in:** the tautology check and temporal-block control required by
`EV-patterns` (see Stage 1). Statistics must include the shuffled-label control that produced the
`tool_name × project` verdict, plus the explicit limitation that it catches marginal-driven artifacts
but not definitional ones.

**Empirical gate:** `asc-9an [EMPIRICAL]` — brief size vs recording rate. This is Stage 0's
unanswered Q6, and it is the **primary failure mode** of the whole product: an empty database.
Per `empirical-planning`, this must be measured against a **real model in a real session**, not
inferred.

**Status: Not Started** (`asc-xgo`, `asc-k6p`, `asc-4so`)

---

## Stage 5: `asc doctor` + cross-project query — epic E9

**Goal** — keep the registry from fragmenting; make the per-project split analytically harmless.

**Success Criteria** — reports dead types, near-duplicate names, drift across versions, per-property
na/unmeasured ratios, and missing exports; `asc query --across` unions multiple project DBs;
`asc types import` round-trips a definition preserving `type_hash`.

**Tests** — fixture registry with known duplicates and one dead type; two-DB ATTACH union.

**Status: Not Started** (`asc-20p`)

---

## Stage E11: Dogfood

**Goal** — drive the real thing, end to end, and find what the suite cannot.

**Success Criteria** — `asc` is used from inside actual Claude Code sessions during real work; the
corpus is grown by that use; an `asc explore` run over the real corpus produces a finding a human
acts on.

**Per `empirical-planning`:** green tests with fixtures ≠ works. The flagship flow — an LLM records
entries unprompted, a human later queries the corpus — **has never run live**. Until it does, every
claim about it is unproven and must be labelled as such.

**Status: Not Started** (`asc-x11`)

---

## Cross-cutting rules (non-negotiable, from `TASKS.md`)

1. Every commit compiles and passes tests. No `--no-verify`. No disabled tests.
2. Core stays pure: `packages/core` and `packages/analysis` have zero `fs`, zero `Date.now()`, zero
   network. Time and IDs are injected. Enforced by test AND `align check`.
3. Omitted, never fabricated: when a value does not exist, omit it. Never write `0` for unknown.
4. Real data only: the real transcripts (read-only), a real model, the real CLI.
5. State limitations plainly. Report failures verbatim.
